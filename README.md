## The challenge
We want you to make this https://github.com/verifymy/sre-backend-node application run in a docker container, which can run on any machine that has docker installed.
Setup a Kubernetes cluster in the GCP cloud and then deploy this application using any CI/CD tool of your choice.
The application must run with the ingress of your choice and must be accessible via the internet.

## Optional:
Note that the description is intentionally not fully detailed. You're free to make assumptions (as long as you spell them out clearly) and make your own improvements that you think might make sense.
Describe possible improvements If possible, implement them.

## Hopefully deliver:
All source code, configuration files etc in one repository on github.
We want you to make your commits normally. Don't just check in the final result, we want to see the commit history to understand how the solution has evolved
A README containing instructions. Use the file also to describe possible conditions you have assumed as well as information that helps us understand what and how you did it.
What will we consider

## We will analyze:
correctness, robustness
Quality (prefer to do fewer things and with quality than to do more and in a questionable way)
Simplicity and readability of the code and the solution as a whole
Possible improvements on top of what was proposed
